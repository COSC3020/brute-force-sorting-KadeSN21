# Brute-Force Sorting

We talked about the complexity of the sorting problem, and used an argument over
all permutations of a list to be sorted to determine its complexity. Implement
a function to sort a list by systematically trying all permutations of the input
list, using the template in `code.js`. Test your new function; I've provided
some basic testing code that uses [jsverify](https://jsverify.github.io/) in
`code.test.js`.

The return value should be the number of permutations that were tried until the
sorted list was "discovered". The unsorted list passed as an argument should be
sorted, i.e. do not copy the list and sort the copy.

## Runtime Analysis

What is the runtime complexity of the algorithm that you implemented? What does
a best case input for your implementation look like, what does a worst case
input look like? How would this complexity change if you generated permutations
randomly without memory instead of systematically trying them?

Describe your reasoning and the conclusion you've come to. Your reasoning is the
most important part. Add your answer to this markdown file.

Both the best and worst case runtime complexity for this algorithm is $O(n!)$, This is because all perutations of the array are generated regardless of the order of input, or if an early permutation is sorted. If permutations were generated randomly, the space taken in memory would decrease, however the time complexity would stay the same if not get logically worse, as every possible permutation of the array must be constructed, and analyzed. The efficiency of this algorithm may decrease further due to possible repeat permutations.
